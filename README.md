# Pixel Sorter
This is a pixel sorter written in Rust, with a GUI built using [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) and [eframe](https://github.com/emilk/eframe_template). That's pretty much it.
I wanted to make it after watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMmmBDRy-jE) excellent YouTube video about the topic.
