# Simple Pixel Sorter
This is a pixel sorter written in Rust, with a GUI built using [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) and [eframe](https://github.com/emilk/eframe_template). It supports vertical and horizontal sorting, and sorting modes (red, green, blue, hue, saturation, lightness, and luminance).

I wanted to make it after watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMmmBDRy-jE) excellent YouTube video about the topic.
